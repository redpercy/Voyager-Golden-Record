The .wav file too large to put into Github, copy this link to download:

https://soundcloud.com/user-482195982/voyager-golden-record-encoded-images

I recommend this site to convert the soundcloud file to a .wav file. Paste the link above into the site below and download the file.

Remember to place the file in the same location as the .ipynb file, and make sure the file name is "voyager_image_data.wav"
